# SVGDRAFTER

## WORKING BRANCH

This might be a silly project but I am generating an SVG file with 
JavaScript in a browser.

- <strike>work on the line element</strike>
- <strike>work on the path element</strike>
- possibly work on a couple of the shape elements
- gotta do the text crap
- figure out some overly complex way to save the raw text
- curves, because not everyone is a cabinet maker
- <strike>AN OFFSET BUTTON! OH YEAH!!!!</strike> Needs tweaking
- Forms and buttons instead of prompts? Will it work?
- come up with a catchy name as this might stick around
- might be time for a nodejs server

## To use:

For the time being just click one of the buttons and answer the prompts.
